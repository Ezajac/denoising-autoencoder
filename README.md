This is a project to clean noisy images of text data using an AutoEncoder with Keras and TensorFlow Backend. The images are denoised and then run through an OCR process using Tesseract to convert the images to text.

The data is available from Kaggle on the Denoising Dirty Documents Project. https://www.kaggle.com/c/denoising-dirty-documents/data
